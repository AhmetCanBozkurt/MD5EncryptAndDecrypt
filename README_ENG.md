# Password Security with MD5 and Salt

## Overview
This project demonstrates a secure way to handle user passwords by implementing the following features:

1. **Password Hashing with MD5**: User passwords are hashed using the MD5 algorithm to ensure they are stored securely and cannot be easily reversed.

2. **Salt Generation**: Before hashing the password, a unique salt is generated using a simple `PasswordGenerator` tool. This salt is appended to the password, adding an extra layer of security against common attacks, such as rainbow table attacks.

## Features
- **MD5 Hashing**: Converts the password into a hashed string.
- **Salt Integration**: Dynamically generates a random salt for each password and appends it before hashing.
- **Improved Security**: Makes the hashing process more robust and resistant to precomputed hash attacks.

## How It Works
1. **Generate a Salt**:
   - Use the `PasswordGenerator` to create a random string (the salt).

2. **Combine Password and Salt**:
   - Append the generated salt to the user's plaintext password.

3. **Hash the Combined String**:
   - Use the MD5 algorithm to hash the concatenated password and salt.

4. **Store the Hashed Password and Salt**:
   - Save the hashed password and its corresponding salt in the database for future verification.

## Example Workflow
```plaintext
User's Plaintext Password: password123
Generated Salt: Xyz789
Combined String: password123Xyz789
MD5 Hash: e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03

Stored in Database:
- Hashed Password: e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
- Salt: Xyz789
```

## Advantages
- **Protection Against Rainbow Tables**: The unique salt ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different.
- **Improved Password Security**: Hashing combined with salting creates a more secure storage mechanism.

## Requirements
- .NET Framework (Version 4.7.2 or higher)
- A library for generating random strings (e.g., `PasswordGenerator`)

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Restore dependencies.
4. Run the application and follow the prompts to hash and store passwords securely.

## Notes
- MD5 is a fast hashing algorithm but not the most secure option for modern applications. For production-grade applications, consider using stronger algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
- Ensure salts are long and unique to maximize security.

## Future Improvements
- Migrate to a more secure hashing algorithm.
- Implement password policies for enhanced user security.
- Add tests to verify password hashing and validation processes.
